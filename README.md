# Entity Relationship Diagram (.erd) Viewer

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## Use this to view any xml based .erd files 
I may decide to add other erd formats later but so far I only generate them with dbeaver which uses XML type formatting

##I guess if you decide to clone this and add other cool stuff let me know!
